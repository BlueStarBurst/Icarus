# Icarus

A 3D avatar I wanted to make that could respond to requests to do specific actions
(ie: walk around the screen)

This is supposed to work in tandem with a server that takes input, creates a chatGPT response, and parses the data into a request by finding keywords
(the repo is private cuz I'm a little stingy)
